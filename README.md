# Piplin

Piplin is an hardware description language (HDL) written in Clojure.

Piplin is no longer in active development. Piplin has been used to synthesize simple VGA drivers and basic processors onto an FPGA. This project is interested, however, I would not try to use it unless you want to mess with the compiler.

Piplin is tested with Clojure versions 1.4+.

You can include it in your project.clj:

    [piplin "0.1.1"]
